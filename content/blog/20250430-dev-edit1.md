I'm ahead of schedule finishing the fourth draft of *The Seer of Redgate*. On May 26, I'll be sending the manuscript to [Philip Athans](https://athansassociates.com/editing.html) ([Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/philathans.bsky.social)) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Athans)), for a developmental edit.

In wonderful coincidence news, it turns out I've read and enjoyed *[The Guide to Writing Fantasy & Science Fiction](https://athansassociates.com/writing.html)*; I only realized that after I hired him.
