I planned on adding a 2nd pass before I called the fourth draft of *The Seer of Redgate* complete, but my upcoming changes are significant enough that I'm calling this the fourth draft.

This was the first draft where I didn't plan any major structural changes. I did end up rewriting and rearranging some scenes, but the story largely stayed the same. The book is coming together. I'm excited.
